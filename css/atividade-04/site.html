        <h2>Hubble Views a Sphere of Stars</h2>
        <img src="imagens/stars.jpg" alt="stars-imagem">
        <p>This huge ball of stars – around 100 billion in total – is an elliptical galaxy located some 55 million light-years away. Known as Messier 89, this galaxy appears to be perfectly spherical; which is unusual for elliptical galaxies that tend to be elongated ellipsoids. The apparently spherical nature of Messier 89 could, however, be a trick of perspective, and the result of its orientation relative to Earth.</p>
